## statement

Optional is a microscopically small (6 lines) library for Scala to provide a variant of `Option`, called `Optional` 
that provides an implicitly defined value. Instead of

    def foo(x: Option[Int]) = x.getOrElse(-1)

    foo(Some(123))

You can now write

    import de.sciss.optional._

    def foo(x: Optional[Int]) = x.getOrElse(-1)

    foo(123)

This is useful for some DSLs where you want to minimise noise for the user.
